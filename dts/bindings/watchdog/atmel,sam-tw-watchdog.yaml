    ATMEL SAM Timing Window Watchdog (TWW). The TWW works with a 32-bit
    timer counter. This component may be enabled at reset by a fuse. The
    default clock is RCSYS which runs at 115kHz.

          Time Out Prescale. Counter bit PSEL is used as watchdog timeout
          period. The minimal value is 7 and max value is 31. This represents
          2pow(PSEL+1) clocks to overflow. The default value is 16 to achieve
          1.139756522s to overflow.

          Time Ban Prescale. Counter bit TBAN is used as watchdog “banned”
          time frame. In this time frame clearing the WDT timer is forbidden,
          otherwise a watchdog reset is generated and the WDT timer is cleared.
          The presence of this property at Device Tree enables Windowing mode,
          otherwise basic mode is activated. The minimal value is 7 and max
          value is 31.
