    Bouffalo Lab pin controller pin configuration nodes. Each node is composed
    by one or more groups, each defining the configuration for a set of pins.

      Bouffalo Lab pin controller pin configuration group. Each group contains
      a list of pins sharing the same set of properties. Example:
      uart0_default: uart0_default {
        /* group 1 (name is arbitrary) */
        pins1 {
          /* configure to uart0 function plus modem interrupt, pin 7 as UART_RX
             pin 16 as UART_TX and finally pin 18 as gpio */
          bflb,pins = <BFLB_PIN(uart0,   7)>,
                      <BFLB_PIN(uart0,  16)>,
                      <BFLB_PIN(gpio,   18)>;
          bflb,signals = <BFLB_SIG_UART_RXD>,
                         <BFLB_SIG_UART_TXD>;
          bias-pull-up;
          input-schmitt-enable;
        };
      };
      The list of supported standard properties:
      - bias-high-impedance: Disable pull-up/down (default behavior, not
        required).
      - bias-pull-up: Enable pull-up resistor.
      - bias-pull-down: Enable pull-down resistor.
      - input-enable: Enable GPIO as input (default behavior, not required).
      - input-schmitt-enable: Enable Schimitt Trigger when GPIO is Input.
      - output-enable: Enable GPIO as output.

      Note that bias options are mutually exclusive. It is the same with GPIO
      input/output enable options.
    properties:
      "bflb,pins":
        required: true
        type: phandle-array
        description: |
          An phandle-array of pins sharing the same group properties. The pins
          should be defined using the BFLB_PIN utility macro that encode
          function and pin. Some special functions require a signal to complete
          route matrix.
      "bflb,signals":
        required: false
        type: array
        description: |
          An optional array that add flags to a pin. The signal flag is defined
          at bflb-pinctrl.h and have BFLB_SIG_ as prefix. It don't require same
          len that bflb,pins property.
      drive-strength:
        required: false
        type: int
        default: 0
        enum:
        - 0     # Default value, lower strength, 8mA
        - 1     # 9.6mA
        - 2     # 11.2mA
        - 3     # highest strength, 12.8mA
        description: |
          Pin drive strength. It tunes pin max current where 0 means lower
          value, which is the default, and 3 represents max drive strength.
