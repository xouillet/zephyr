SAM4L WM-400 Cape
#################

Overview
********

The SAM4L WM-400 Cape is a full featured design to enable IEEE 802.15.4 low
power nodes. It is a Beaglebone Black cape concept with an Atmel AT86RF233
radio transceiver. User can develop Touch interface and have access to many
sensors and conectivity buses.

The default configuration can be found in the Kconfig
:zephyr_file:`boards/arm/sam4l_wm400_cape/sam4l_wm400_cape_defconfig`.

Connections and IOs
===================

The `SAM4L WM-400 Cape Schematic`_ has detailed information about board
connections. Download the `SAM4L WM-400 Cape Schematic`_ for more detail.

System Clock
============

The SAM4L MCU is configured to use the 12 MHz internal oscillator on the board
with the on-chip PLL to generate an 48 MHz system clock.

Serial Port
===========

The ATSAM4LC4B MCU has 4 USARTs. One of the USARTs (USART3) is shared between
RS-232 and RS-485 interfaces. The default console terminal is available at
RS-232 onboard port.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The SAM4L WM-400 Cape board needs a Segger `J-Link OB <https://www.segger.com/jlink-ob.html>`_.
This provides a debug interface to the SAM4LC4B chip. You can use Ozone or
JLink to communicate with the SAM4LC4B.

Flashing
========

#. Download JLink from the Segger `JLink Downloads Page`_. Go to the section
   "J-Link Software and Documentation Pack" and install the "J-Link Software and
   Documentation pack for Linux". The application JLinkExe needs to be accessible
   from your path.

#. Run your favorite terminal program to listen for output. Under Linux the
   terminal should be :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`. For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -o

   The -o option tells minicom not to send the modem initialization
   string. Connection should be configured as follows:

   - Speed: 115200
   - Data: 8 bits
   - Parity: None
   - Stop bits: 1

#. Connect the SAM4L WM-400 Cape board to your host computer using the
   USB debug port. Then build and flash the :ref:`hello_world`
   application.

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: sam4l_wm400_cape
      :goals: build flash

   You should see "Hello World! sam4l_wm400_cape" in your terminal.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: sam4l_wm400_cape
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
